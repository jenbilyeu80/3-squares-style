/* Complete the while loop body such that each iteratioin increases count by 1 and then use console.log() to display the current count.
Run the code to check your answer.  When finished, your console should list the numbers 1-10.
1.  First, make the while loop increment count by 1.
2. Then, make the loop console.log() the current count.*/



/*let count = 0;
while (count < 10){
    count = count + 1;
    console.log(count); 
}*/

/*for(let i = 1; i<11;i++){
    console.log(i);
}*/

//more practice with while loop

let count = 16;
while(count > 0){
    count = count - 1;
    console.log(count);

}
